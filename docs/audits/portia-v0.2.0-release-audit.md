# Portia v0.2.0 Release Audit

## Status

Issue #54 is the final ethical, privacy, architecture, usability, package, and release gate for Portia v0.2.0.

Phase: **Phase 1 — audit and release preparation**  
Final verdict: **PENDING**

`RELEASED — VERIFIED` is not available until publication and fresh-download verification are complete.

## Starting authority

The audit begins from the reconciled Issue #53 handoff:

```text
Portia commit:
d2cca3b7d8eb59087016d4da60e623960758a729

Portia tree:
33067ffdd35047d2c6ac575cc7d21969c2a3862b
```

Before Slice 1 changed repository bytes, the applying operator ran the complete authoritative Issue #53 repository validator against that exact commit/tree and obtained:

```text
Portia Issue #53 repository qualification passed
```

Captured baseline execution:

```text
captured at UTC: 2026-10-06T23:47:24+00:00
Python:          3.11.9
host platform:   Windows-10-10.0.26200-SP0
```

The baseline evidence is deliberately pre-change evidence. Later Issue #54 qualification must validate the release-preparation state independently.

## Exact Core qualification authority

Current release qualification uses the exact released Core 0.6.4 artifact:

```text
pds_core-0.6.4-py3-none-any.whl
SHA-256: 48cea9317f2967bdc0f2d4c14349a56677c7c3f8211f0f33978ccb1a1c75859b
release source: 152d1c65064c4f8fe55249ff2ca3379d7c4d6ccb
```

Historical compatibility evidence retains the exact released Core 0.6.3 artifact:

```text
pds_core-0.6.3-py3-none-any.whl
SHA-256: 98d7596ce0eed26e4d56a17bbbbd644db3014259b56a45783a173fe8237af5e5
```

These facts remain distinct:

```text
minimum supported Core: pds-core>=0.6.3,<0.7
current final qualification authority: exact Core 0.6.4 release artifact
```

## Release contract frozen for audit

Slice 1 mechanically protects the following candidate identity:

```text
distribution: pds-portia
version: 0.2.0
Requires-Python: >=3.11
runtime Core: pds-core>=0.6.3,<0.7
console script: portia = portia.cli:main
module operations: portia = portia.pds_operations:get_module_operations_profile
sibling PDS runtime dependency: none
publication-producer capability: none
```

This is an audit boundary, not release approval.

## Audit domains

The machine-readable audit state keeps the following domains explicitly pending until evidence is reviewed:

1. ethical neutrality and epistemic distinctions;
2. teacher-local authority;
3. sensitive-data minimization and privacy;
4. record distinction and identity;
5. architecture and ownership;
6. storage, path, history, and compatibility;
7. recovery, failure, and Integrity behavior;
8. teacher usability and workload;
9. menu and terminology;
10. read-only surfaces;
11. packaging and public surfaces;
12. documentation reconciliation;
13. release contract and mechanical qualification;
14. cumulative repository qualification;
15. Python/platform qualification.

A pending domain is not a pass and is not a defect classification. Concrete defects discovered during review are recorded separately in the findings register.

## Foundation-audit handoff

The release audit explicitly reopens the implementation questions inherited from the foundation audit without rewriting their historical disposition. The machine-readable state carries PF-AUD-005 through PF-AUD-012 as re-audit obligations, including:

- append-preserving recovery;
- privacy-safe teacher review workload;
- production application validation;
- institutional policy dependencies;
- unimplemented future retention/publication capabilities;
- reconciliation of the historical no-runtime scope boundary;
- legal/regulatory non-certification.

Historical Issue #23 evidence remains historical evidence.

## Finding model

Concrete Issue #54 findings use IDs of the form `P54-AUD-###` and preserve, at minimum:

```text
finding ID
audit domain
classification
summary
exact evidence
affected files/contracts
expected behavior
observed problem
risk/consequence
required disposition
resolution
validation evidence
follow-up issue if any
status
```

Allowed classifications are:

```text
BLOCKER
MAJOR
MINOR
ACCEPTED LIMITATION
DEFERRED / FUTURE
```

Release preparation cannot finish with an unresolved BLOCKER or MAJOR finding.

## Legal and authority boundary

Portia v0.2.0 release approval is not FERPA certification, state-law certification, district-policy approval, clinical approval, special-education compliance certification, legal advice, records-management certification, or institutional authorization to use Portia for regulated case management.

Portia remains teacher-local. A recorded teacher decision is not silently upgraded into an institutional, district, legal, clinical, or disciplinary decision.

## Synthetic-data boundary

Issue #54 qualification uses synthetic evidence only. It must never be run against or populated from a real teacher workspace.

## Slice 1 conclusion

Slice 1 creates durable audit state and a focused mechanical validator. It intentionally makes no production runtime changes and records no substantive audit-domain PASS result yet.

Final verdict: **PENDING**
